# python-genetic

Simple Implementation of a genetic algorithm. I implemented this just for fun after watching the MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence course (Fall 2010). You find the video about Genetic Algorithms [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHyNqSnzP8Y&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi&index=15&t=0s).

I think much has been said about these kind of algorithms and my algorithm is mainly to illustrate and understand the concepts. For more information navigate to the course or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

## Prerequisites

```
$ git clone git@github.com:tobiasw225/python-genetic.git
$ python3.11 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```

[main.py](main.py) offers an entry point to play around. 
To plot the solutions, you need to install matplotlib.
